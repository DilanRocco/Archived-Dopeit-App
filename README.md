# Archived-Dopeit-App

Created an iOS app to bring people together during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unsure of where to start, I said why don't I create a fun little game. The idea my friend and I arrived on was a Trivia and Debate app which rotated through themes each month. The users on the top of the leaderboard would earn a percentage of the money earned from the app through advertising.
